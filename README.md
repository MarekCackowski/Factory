# Description
Factory consist of 5 production lines, divided into stages, on which products are made from two different types of raw materials.
Materials are delivered by a single car separatively, when their number fall below lower limit.
Products at first are stored in packages, in the dump, and then moved to warehouse by trolley with limited capacity.
Production line stops manufacturing new product if the dump is full, and if there are no materials - whole factory stops production.
